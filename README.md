KodeGo Activities and assignments


 I created a repository specifically for the program, which I used to store all of my project work and assignments. The repository was organized into several folders, each corresponding to a different module or topic covered in the bootcamp.
 
 I maintained an active presence in the repository throughout the program, committing and pushing changes on a regular basis. I also collaborated with other participants on some projects, using the repository to share code and collaborate on assignments.

One notable achievement related to my repository activity was the completion of a final project for the bootcamp, which I submitted through the repository. The project involved building a full-stack web application using React and Node.js, and required significant collaboration and teamwork with other participants. Through this project, I was able to apply many of the skills and concepts I had learned throughout the program, and the repository played a crucial role in helping us manage the codebase and track progress.

Overall, my repository activity during the KodeGo Bootcamp demonstrated my commitment to the program and my ability to apply new skills and knowledge in a practical setting. It also helped me develop strong collaboration and version control skills, which will be valuable as I continue to pursue a career in software development.
